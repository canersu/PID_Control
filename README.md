    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## PID.cpp

In PID.cpp, private variables initialized as stated in Init method lines between 12-14. To differentiate errors, UpdateError method is called which computes the differential error, sum error and proportional error. And finally TotalError method returns the multiplied calculated errors with Kp, Ki and Kd coefficients.

## Fine Tuning Kp Ki and Kd coefficients

To start tuning, I chose integral term 0.0 and proportional term 1.0, and find the optimal differential term. Increasing differential term caused overshoot, decreasing differential caused saggy turning behavior especially in road curvatures. I found the optimal value as 2.0.

Then I started to tune proportional term by setting differential coefficient 2.0 and integral 0.0. Vehicle made "S" move in the center as I started to play around 3.0. I found the optimal proportional value as 0.2.

After P and D coefficients set, the last thing was to prevent drifting from the center of road. That is why integral coefficient dive in to game. A small value would be enough, 0.004 was solved the drift problem.

## Future Optimizations

Final optimizations takes long time. Twiddle optimization algorithm could be a good idea for some parts of circuits to observe the vehicle's movement and choose the best coefficient with the smallest Kp Ki and Kd error values.

To drive smooth, also speed controller could be include to algorithm which makes the vehicle keep in same speed and better acceleration/deceleration behavior.
